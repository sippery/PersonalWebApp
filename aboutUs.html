        Henry is a grade 12 highschool student attending WTCS 
        in Toronto. After beginning to program in 2021 on a whim, 
        he took to it as a hobby and has been attending classes as well as programmig on his own time ever since.
        Although he has no intentions of working in tech, he's 
        excited to continue to pursue it casually, and see what 
        interesting and useful things he can create!</p>

    <p>Kai is a grade 12 Student currently enrolled in 
        Western Technical Commercial School's Robotics Program. 
        When he initially came to this school, his goal was to pursue 
        engineering, however, he has since decided that he enjoys 
        having a life too much! This is why his pursuit in tech 
        is now purely for self-enjoyment and fun.</p><br>

        Henry is a grade 12 highschool student attending WTCS 
        in Toronto. After beginning to program in 2021 on a whim, 
        he took to it as a hobby and has been attending classes as well as programmig on his own time ever since.
        Although he has no intentions of working in tech, he's 
        excited to continue to pursue it casually, and see what 
        interesting and useful things he can create!</p>
